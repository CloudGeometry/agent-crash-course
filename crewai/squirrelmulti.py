    INTEL REPORT: BADGER'S GARDEN - GOLDEN ACORN
    ---------------------------------------------
    TARGET: Golden Acorn, located under the large, creaky oak tree in the garden's center.
    OCCUPANT: 'Grumples' the Badger. Known Napping Cycle: 13:00-16:00 hours (local time). Temperament: Extremely territorial.
    KNOWN HAZARDS:
    1. Noisy Gravel Perimeter: Surrounds the entire garden.
    2. Automated Sprinkler System: West lawn, unpredictable schedule.
    3. 'FiFi' the Poodle: Small, loud, south fence patrol. Distractions: High-pitched noises, sudden movements.
    POTENTIAL ENTRY POINTS:
    - North Fence Gap: Behind compost bin.
    - Overhanging Maple Branch: West side, into rose bushes (thorny).
    NOTES: Last structural check: 2 days ago. Location: Fort Erie, Ontario vicinity.
